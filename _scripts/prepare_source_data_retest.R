# Created by tarflow.iquizoo::use_targets().
# Follow the comments below to fill in this target script.
# Then follow the manual to check and run the pipeline:
#   https://books.ropensci.org/targets/walkthrough.html#inspect-the-pipeline

# Load packages required to define the pipeline:
library(targets)

# Set target options:
tar_option_set(
  packages = c("tarflow.iquizoo"), # packages that your targets need to run
  format = "qs", # Optionally set the default storage format. qs is fast.
  error = "null",
  #
  # For distributed computing in tar_make(), supply a {crew} controller
  # as discussed at https://books.ropensci.org/targets/crew.html.
  # Choose a controller that suits your needs. For example, the following
  # sets a controller with 8 workers which will run as local R processes:
  controller = crew::crew_controller_local(workers = 8)
  # Set other options as needed.
)

# Run the R scripts in the R/ folder with your custom functions:
tar_source()

contents <- tarflow.iquizoo:::fetch_iquizoo_mem(
  readr::read_file("sql/contents_with_retest.sql")
)

# Replace the target list below with your own:
list(
  tarflow.iquizoo::tar_prep_iquizoo(
    contents = contents,
    what = "raw_data", # change to "scores" or "raw_data" if you want to
    action_raw_data = "all",
    check_progress = FALSE # set as `FALSE` if projects finalized
  )
  # more targets goes here
)
